# StatinWise Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** July 1, 2025

## 1. Introduction  
Welcome to StatinWise (“we,” “us,” or “our”). Your privacy is important. This Privacy Policy explains how StatinWise — a clinician-only, on-device decision support app for statin therapy — handles information.

## 2. Information We **Do Not** Collect  
- **No Personal Data Transmission:** StatinWise does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal health information on our servers.  
- **No Analytics or Tracking:** We do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.  

## 3. Information Stored Locally  
All user inputs (patient demographics, lab values, medical history, risk enhancers) are stored **only** on your device. We leverage iOS Data Protection (AES-256) to encrypt data at rest.

## 4. How We Use Your Information  
- **On-Device Calculations:** All guideline algorithms run locally to generate statin recommendations.  
- **No Sharing:** We do not share your data with any third parties, including cloud services, health networks, or advertisers.

## 5. Security Measures  
- **Encryption:** Data at rest is encrypted via Apple’s standard crypto APIs (AES-256).  
- **Offline-First:** StatinWise functions entirely offline; no network calls are made for user data.  
- **App Store Compliance:** Because we only use Apple’s built-in encryption, no additional export compliance filings are needed.

## 6. Third-Party Services  
StatinWise does not integrate any third-party SDKs, marketplaces, or analytics services.

## 7. Children’s Privacy  
StatinWise is intended for clinical use by healthcare professionals. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy  
We may update this policy to reflect changes to our practices or legal requirements. We’ll post the revised policy here with an updated “Effective Date.”
